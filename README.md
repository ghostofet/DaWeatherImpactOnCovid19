#***For using BigQuery API you must register Google cloud platform account first. And you must create credential file in order to use BigQuery API by setting up attentication.
#***To create the credential, follow the instruction in this website https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/libraries
#***After create the credential file that is a .json file. Upload that credential file to the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS path above or the path you need.
